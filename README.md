# MNIST-Handwritten-Number

This is an MNIST Handwritten Number Classifier with a small twist. The code takes three MNIST numbers and stacks them. If the first number is even, then 

The code uses two convolutional neural network layers, and two dense layers to classify if what a number is, and another to classify if a number is even or odd.
